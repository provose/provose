    "content": "The Provose batch configures resources for AWS Batch, which is fully-managed batch processing system for Dockerized workloads. How AWS Batch works . A full explanation of AWS Batch is outside the scope of the Provose documentation. You can learn more by reading the AWS Batch documentation. However, there are some important AWS Batch concepts to understand in order to use them with Provose: . | Jobs – A Job describes a computation to be done as described with a Docker image and some parameters (see below). This Provose module does not specify or submit Jobs. You must submit them with the AWS Console, the AWS API or the AWS CLI. The AWS Batch documentation page titled Submitting a Job has more information. | Job Definitions – A Job Definition is a blueprint for how Jobs are made. Job Definitions are configured below under the job_definitions key. Some of the parameters specified in a Job Definition can be overriden when specifying a job. | Docker images – AWS Batch Job Definitions are based on a Docker image that contains the code to be run in a job. You can read more about building and running Docker images on your local machine in the Docker documentation. You can create images on your your local computer and use Provose to upload your images to Amazon Web Services, after which they will be available for AWS Batch. | Job Queues – A Job Queue accepts Jobs until the Compute Environment is ready to accept the Job. You can define multiple Job Queues with different priorities below with the job_queues key. | Compute Environments – A Compute Environment pulls Jobs from the Job Queues to run them. A Compute Environment contains a pool of EC2 instances–with instance types of your choosing. The number of instances in the Compute Environment can scale up or down with the length of the queue. | . You can read more precise versions of the above definitions in the AWS Batch documentation. AWS Batch allows many-to-many configurations between Job Definitions and Compute Environments, but for the sake of simplicity, Provose assumes that you’ll only want one Compute Environment for every Job Definition you write. If you need more complex configurations, you should write your AWS Batch configuration directly with the Terraform AWS Batch module. Security limitations of AWS Batch . AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) can fetch secrets from AWS Secrets Manager and present them as environment variables to a container. However, AWS Batch currently does not have a similar integration with Secrets Manager. If you want to pass secrets to AWS Batch using environment variables, they will not be encrypted. If you want to pass environment variables to a container using AWS Batch, you can use the environment key documented below. You can use this method to pass secret values, but it would be more secure for your container process to contact AWS Secrets Manager directly. Naming conventions . The names you provide Provose for queue and job names are global within the AWS Region. This means that if you use AWS Batch in two different Provose modules, you should take care not to reuse the same names. ",

The list must also only contain instances of the same CPU architecture–you cannot have both x86 instances and ARM instances in the same list. | compute_environment_type – Required. The type of compute environment. Set this to \"EC2\" to deploy EC2 On-Demand instances for this Compute Environment. If you set this vlaue to \"SPOT\", you can save money by using AWS Spot Instances instead. | min_vcpus – Required. This is the minimum number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) to maintain in the Compute Environment. These many vCPUs will be continually available for new jobs, even if the queue is empty. However, you can set this value to 0 to instruct AWS Batch to shut off the compute resources when the queue is empty. | max_vcpus – Required. This is the maximum number of virtual CPUs (vCPUs) that are available in the Compute Environment.o . | ami_id – Optional. If you wish, you can set this to a custom Amazon Machine Image for the compute resources to run.

This is mapping from queue names to objects with the given keys. | state – Required. This is \"ENABLED\" to enable the queue or \"DISABLED\" to disable the queue. | priority – Required. This is an integer value that describes the priority of this queue. A larger number gives this queue a higher priority in the attached Compute Environment. | . | job_definitions – Optional.

    "content": "Certificate Transparency is an Internet security standard at protecting the chain of trust for digital certificates used on the Internet. Digital certificates are used to prevent communications on the Internet from eavesdropping or tampering in-transit. These certificates are issued by organizations called Certificate Authorities (CAs), who must be trusted to issue certificates that contain accurate information. Malicious actors, such as individual hackers or national governments, often target Certificate Authorities with the goal of issuing fraudulent certificates that can be used to impersonate a website. When they succeed, it is very difficult to detect and revoke these fraudulent certificates. Certificate Transparency aims to make detecting fraudulent certificates by creating a public log to record certificates issued by publicly trusted Certificate Authorities. ",

    "title": "How does Provose interact with Certificate Transparency?",
    "content": "Provose creates multiple certificates–for securing communciations both within private networks and across the Internet. All of these certificates are published to Certificate Transparency. Every time you create a Provose module with the module keyword, Provose creates a new Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and an Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate to protect communications within the VPC. In order for this certificate to automatically be trusted by web browsers like Google Chrome, Amazon publishes the certificate’s metadata to the Certificate Transparency log. It is possible to disable this publishing, but then web browsers would throw an error when visiting a webpage secured by this certificate. This means that if your internal_root_domain is set to \"example-internal.com\" and your internal_subdomain is set to \"myproject\", then anybody in the world can see that Amazon issued a wildcard certificate for \"*.myproject.example-internal.com\". Provose provisions an internal HTTPS Application Load Balancer (ALB) that uses this wildcard certificate. If you have an Elasticsearch instance located at \"elasticsearch.myproject.example-internal.com\", Provose will serve traffic from the already-created wildcard certificate, so Certificate Transparency will not log the full DNS name of these services. However, if you use Provose to deploy containers serving HTTP requests–whether they come from within the VPC or from the public Internet–then Provose will provision another ACM certificate with the exact DNS name for your service–not a wildcard certificate. This means that if you deployed a container that serves traffic at \"container.example-internal.com\" or \"container.example.com\", Amazon will log the full DNS name to the public Certificate Transparency logs. In the future, Provose might reissue this certificate as a wildcard of \"*.example.com\" in an effort to leak less information to Certificate Transparency. However, this will only benefit DNS names that were created after this change was made. Additionally, it is only possible to protect only one subdomain level with a wildcard certificate. If you are serving traffic at \"long.dns.name.example.com\", the wildcard certificate logged to Certificate Transparency would be \"*.dns.name.example.com\". And remember–the Certificate Transparency log is forever. If Provose issues a certificate, and the certificate later expires or is deleted, the Certificate Transparency log will still have recorded the certificate’s existence. Do not issue certificates with DNS names that are embarrassing, must be kept secret, or reveal information about your infrastructure that you do not want to give away. ",

For example, to use the nginxdemos/hello container on Docker Hub, set name to \"nginxdemos/hello\" and private_registry to false. | tag – Required. The Docker Registry tag of the image to use. This may be a particular tag or version number in Docker Hub or Elastic Container Registry (ECR). However, \"latest\" is a common value to pick the latest version of an image in the registry. | private_registry – Required. Set this to true to look for a container with the name set in name in your AWS account’s private Elastic Container Registry (ECR). You should configure the ECR repository for this image with the Provose image key. Set this to false to use a publicly-available container on Docker Hub. | . | instances – Required. This is an object that defines how this container is run. | instance_type – Required. Set this to \"FARGATE\" to deploy the containers on AWS Fargate. Set this to \"FARGATE_SPOT\" to use Fargate with Spot instances–which can give cost savings of up to 70%. Note that with Fargate, it will not be possible to use bind_mounts to mount to the host. However, if you want to deploy these containers on AWS EC2 instances, set this to the instance type of your choice, like \"t3.small\". Keep in mind that AWS does not make all instance types available in all Availability Zones. | container_count – Required. This is the number of containers to deploy. | instance_count – Optional. This field is required if instance_type is an EC2 instance type, but is unused when instance_type is \"FARGATE\" or \"FARGATE_SPOT\". | key_name – Optional. Set this to the name of an AWS EC2 key pair in your account to enable SSH access to the instances. This only works if the instance_type is an EC2 instance type and not \"FARGATE\" or \"FARGATE_SPOT\". | bash_user_data – Optional. This is a bash script that will be run on the creation of the underlying AWS instances. This field does nothing if the container is deployed with AWS Fargate. | cpu – Required. The CPU units given to each container. 1024 CPU units maps to one vCPU on AWS. This is a minimum of 128 if instance_type is an EC2 instance type, or 256 if the instance type is Fargate. | memory – Required. The amount of memory–in megabytes–given to each container. This must be in proportion. For example, a Fargate task with 256 CPU units can have 512, 1024, or 2048 megabytes of memory. | . | user – Optional. Defines an alternate user to run the container’s command. This is equivalent to passing --user to docker run. Docker containers typically have a default user they run as, and this key is only needed to override that default. You can specify a user or group either by name or by UID and GID, in the following formats: . | \"user\" | \"user:group\" | \"uid\" | \"gid\" | \"user:gid\" | \"uid:group\" | . | entrypoint – Optional. Defines a custom container entrypoint, if you do not want to use the entrypoint defined within the container. | command – Optional. Defines a custom container command. Use this if you do not want to use the command defined within the container. | environment – Optional. This is a mapping of environment variables and their values. | secrets – Optional. This is a mapping of environment variable names to Provose secret names. | efs_volumes – Optional. This is a mapping of the AWS Elastic File System (EFS) volumes to mount within the container. | container_mount – Required. The path in the container to mount the EFS volume. | . | bind_mounts – Optional. This is only for containers running with an EC2 instance_type. These are mounted filesystem paths from the EC2 host into the containers. This will not work for containers running on AWS Fargate because there is no concept of a host with a filesystem. | host_mount – Required. The directory on the container host to mount in the container. | container_mount – Required. The path in the container to mount the host filesystem. | . | public – Optional. This mapping configures network access from the public IPv4 Internet to the container. | https – Optional. This mapping configures the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that allows HTTP/HTTPS requests from the public Internet to the container. Use this if your container is an HTTP server. | public_dns_names – Required. A list of DNS names–like example.com or subdomain.example.com to point at this container. Your AWS account must own the underlying domain name and be able to set the DNS records. Provose will also generate Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for the DNS names provided–enabling access to the container via HTTPS. | internal_http_port – Required. This is the port exposed by the container to serve HTTP requests. The load balancer listens on port 80 and 443 to forward ports to the given port on the container. | internal_http_health_check_path – Required. This is a URL path, like /robots.txt, that the Application Load Balancer (ALB) checks to determine whether the container is healthy. This path must return a 200 OK If the ALB decides a container is unhealthy, it will be removed from routing. | internal_http_health_check_success_status_codes – Optional. A list or range of HTTP status codes that the Application Load Balancer (ALB) will consider to be healthy. This can be a list of values like \"200,301\" or a range of values like \"200-299\". This corresponds with the matcher parameter of health_check objects on Terraform aws_lb_target_group resources. This defaults to only considering the HTTP code 200 as healthy. | internal_http_health_check_timeout – Optional. This sets the timeout for the HTTP requests that the Application Load Balancer (ALB)’s health checks. If this field is omitted, it defaults to 5 seconds. | stickiness_cookie_duration_seconds – Optional. If this value is present, it enables stickiness on the Application Load Balancer. Stickiness is the mechanism for client requests to consistently be routed to the same container instance behind the Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB sets an HTTP cookie for the first client request it receives, and then checks for the cookie on subsequent requests. The cookie eventually expires, and this value sets the expiration for the cookie–in seconds. | . | . | vpc – Optional. This mapping configures network access to the container from within the VPC that Provose creates. | https – Optional. This mapping configures the Application Load Balancer (ALB) that allows HTTP/HTTPS traffic from within the VPC. Use this if your container is an HTTP server. | vpc_dns_names – Required. A list of DNS names–like example.com or subdomain.example.com to point at this container. These domains must be used to serve internal traffic to your VPC. The vpc Provose configuration does not serve traffic to the public Internet. Your AWS account must own the underlying domain name and be able to set the DNS records. Provose will also generate Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) certificate for the DNS names provided–enabling access to the container via HTTPS. | internal_http_port – Required. This is the port exposed by the container to serve HTTP requests. The load balancer listens on port 80 and 443 to forward ports to the given port on the container. | internal_http_health_check_path – Required. This is a URL path, like /robots.txt, that the Application Load Balancer (ALB) checks to determine whether the container is healthy. This path must return a 200 OK If the ALB decides a container is unhealthy, it will be removed from routing. | internal_http_health_check_timeout – Optional. This sets the timeout for the HTTP requests that the Application Load Balancer (ALB)’s health checks. If this field is omitted, it defaults to 5 seconds. | stickiness_cookie_duration_seconds – Optional. If this value is present, it enables stickiness on the Application Load Balancer. Stickiness is the mechanism for client requests to consistently be routed to the same container instance behind the Application Load Balancer (ALB). The ALB sets an HTTP cookie for the first client request it receives, and then checks for the cookie on subsequent requests. The cookie eventually expires, and this value sets the expiration for the cookie–in seconds. | . | . | s3_buckets – Optional. This is a mapping of S3 buckets to the classes of permissions available to the instances. The four classes of permissions available are list, get, put, and delete, and the values for each one is true or false. To use this configuration, place the s3_buckets key inside a block that defines a container. Below is an example of how to give the container access to two buckets–one with list and get permissions, and another with get and delete permissions. | . s3_buckets = { \"some-bucket-name.example-internal.com\" = { permissions = { list = true get = true put = false delete = false } } \"another-bucket.com\" = { permissions = { list = false get = true put = false delete = true } } } .

If you set instance_count to be greater than one, then the instances will be bob-1, bob-2, and so forth. | key_name – Optional. The name of the AWS key pair. | ami_id – Optional. The ID of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to deploy for this instance. By default, Provose will deploy an ECS-optimized GPU-ready Amazon Linux 2 AMI–specifically amzn2-ami-ecs-gpu-hvm-2.0.20200218-x86_64-ebs. New users of Provose might want to choose a newer AMI, but Provose cannot update the default AMI for existing users without causing their existing instances to be destroyed and recreated. | availability_zone – Optional.

This is a grouping for network settings only within the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that Provose creates. | secrets – Optional. This is a list of AWS Secrets Manager secret names that this EC2 instance should have access to. This setting only configures access. You have to fetch the secrets yourself in your application with the AWS API. The secrets key in the containers module goes a step further and loads your secrets as environment variables. | associate_public_ip_address – Optional. Defaults to true, which provisions a public IPv4 address for this instance. However, it will not be possible to make inbound requests to the instance using this IP address unless you also choose to open TCP ports with the public.tcp key or the UDP ports with the public.udp key. The public IP address that AWS gives this instance should be considered temporary.

This key is for adding additional, custom security groups in addition to what Provose sets up from the public and vpc keys. You may want to add a custom security group with a more specific CIDR. | root_block_device – Optional These are optional settings about the Elastic Block Storage (EBS) volume that stores the root filesystem for this EC2 instance. | volume_type – Optional. This is the type of EBS volume. Values can be either \"standard\", \"gp2\", \"io1\", \"sc1\", or \"st1\", with \"standard\" being the default. | volume_size_gb – Optional. This is the size of the EBS volume in gigabytes. This defaults to the root volume size defined in the underlying Amazon Machine Image (AMI) and will never be less than the minimum. | delete_on_termination – Optional. This defaults to true, which deletes the EBS volume if the instance is terminated. Set this to false to keep the root EBS volume in your account after instance termination. | encrypted – Optional. Set this to true to encrypt the EBS volume. This value is false by default. | kms_key_id – Optional.

    "content": "How DNS works for Provose Elasticsearch clusters . The Amazon Elasticsearch service creates long and hard-to-remember names for clusters and their associated Kibana dashboards. Provose sets up an internal Application Load Balancer to map an easy-to-remember DNS name name to the cluster. This DNS name, load balancer, Elasticsearch cluster, and Kibana dashboard is not available on the public Internet. For security reasons, they are all only available within the VPC that Provose creates for Elasticsearch cluster. The internal Application Load Balance redirects requests to the Elasticsearch cluster or Kibana dashboard via an HTTP 301 redirect. Some Elasticsearch clients–such as the one Logstash uses–will treat the HTTP 301 code as an error as opposed to following the redirect. For these clients, you will need to use the DNS name for the Elasticsearch cluster or the Kibana dashboard set by AWS. Provose also offers its own deployment of Logstash that is configured to work correctly with Provose’s deployment of Elasticsearch. How to use Provose to deploy Logstash . The Provose elasticsearch_clusters module allows the provisioning of Logstash on an AWS EC2 instance. Logstash is a data processing engine used to commonly format and ingest logs for indexing into Elasticsearch. Logstash is not a required component to Elasticsearch, so Logstash configuration is purely optional. This Logstash configuration is for development purposes only. It will not autoscale to large amounts of logs to be ingested. If your provose_config.internal_root_domain is \"example.com\", your provose_config.internal_subdomain is \"subdomain\", and your Elasticsearch cluster name is \"cluster\", then the Logstash DNS name is \"cluster-logstash.subdomain.example.com\" on UDP port 5959. Provose currently does not support advanced Logstash configurations. If you need that, you should consider running your own Logstash instance through either the Provose ec2_instances or containers modules. The differences between Amazon Elasticsearch Service and Elastic.co’s Elasticsearch . Elasticsearch is an open-source search engine and database that is primarily maintained by the company Elastic NV. Elastic has created various proprietary add-ons for Elasticsearch. These are generally not available on the AWS Elasticsearch Service. However, Amazon has developed many equivalent features and released them under the Apache 2.0 license as the Open Distro for Elasticsearch. If the Open Distro does not fit your needs and you want to use Elastic’s proprietary features, Provose’s elasticsearch_clusters module will not be able to fulfill your needs. ",

If you have multiple sets of credentials in these files, you can tell Provose which credentials you want to use with the AWS_PROFILE environment variable. You can also set credentials directly with the environment variables AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY. If you are running Provose on an AWS EC2 instance, Provose can use the credentials in the IAM instance profile for the instance. AWS has a documentation page about how to use instance profiles. ",

    "content": "Terraform operates by tracking the state of your AWS configuration and then applying any differences between your local Terraform files and the state. By default, Terraform stores state information in a local file named terraform.tfstate, but Terraform can also work with state stored remotely in the cloud. Provose recommends that you store your Terraform state in an Amazon S3 bucket that is accessible to every user that needs to run Terraform, but nobody else. Your Terraform state contains secrets that could be used to compromise resources in your AWS account, so make sure that nobody untrusted can access it. Terraform’s enterprise version also offers remote state storage, but that is beyond the scope of this tutorial. All features of Provose are available through the free and open-source version of Terraform. If the domain name you have chosen was example-internal.com and you want to deploy to the AWS region us-east-1, then Provose’s recommended Terraform state configuration looks like: . terraform { # Look out. We're going to replace this `backend \"local\"` block with # a `backend \"s3\"` block later in the tutorial. backend \"local\" { path = \"terraform.tfstate\" } required_providers { # Provose v3.0 currently uses the Terraform AWS provider 2.54.0. # Stick with this version for your own code to avoid compatibility # issues. aws = \"2.54.0\" } } provider \"aws\" { region = \"us-east-1\" } # This is an AWS Key Management Service (KMS) key that we will use to # encrypt the AWS S3 bucket. resource \"aws_kms_key\" \"terraform\" { description = \"Used to encrypt the Terraform state S3 bucket at rest.\" tags = { Provose = \"terraform\" } lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true } } # This is where we store the Terraform remote tfstate. resource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"terraform\" { # This should be a globally-unique Amazon S3 bucket, although it # should not be accessible outside of the AWS credentials you use to run # Terraform. bucket = \"terraform-state.example-internal.com\" acl = \"private\" # For security and compliance reasons, Provose recommends that you # configure AWS Key Management Service (KMS) encryption at rest for # the bucket. server_side_encryption_configuration { rule { apply_server_side_encryption_by_default { kms_master_key_id = aws_kms_key.terraform.arn sse_algorithm = \"aws:kms\" } } } versioning { enabled = true } tags = { Provose = \"terraform\" } # This lifecycle parameter prevents Terraform from destroying the # bucket that contains its own state. lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true } } # This prevents public access to our remote Terraform tfstate. resource \"aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block\" \"terraform\" { bucket = aws_s3_bucket.terraform.id block_public_acls = true block_public_policy = true ignore_public_acls = true restrict_public_buckets = true lifecycle { prevent_destroy = true } } . We recommend that you place the above configuration in a file named terraform.tf. To keep things organized, you may want to put your Provose configuration into a separate file. This configuration creates the S3 bucket that you will use for remote state, but Terraform must store state in the local file terraform.tfstate before the S3 bucket is created. After saving terraform.tf, run the following commands: . terraform init terraform plan -out plan.out terrafrom apply \"plan.out\" . ",

For example, terabyte-scale machine learning typically requires fast storage, and FSx Lustre is a popular choice. Beware of long timeouts and “tainting” . AWS FSx Lustre clusters can take a long time to deploy–even multiple hours. By default, Terraform will wait 30 minutes before timing out. When this happens, you should use the AWS Web Console or the command line to check the status of your cluster. When you see a timeout from Terraform, you should not rerun Terraform before the cluster has finished deploying, otherwise this will destroy your cluster. When your cluster has finished deploying, Terraform might consider it “tainted” because it timed out during the cluster’s creation. However, in all likelihood, your cluster is most likely fine. If Terraform says something like . # module.{your-module-name}.aws_fsx_lustre_file_system.lustre_file_systems[\"{your-cluster-name}\"] is tainted, so must be replaced . then run this command: . terraform untaint 'module.{your-module-name}.aws_fsx_lustre_file_system.lustre_file_systems[\"{your-cluster-name}\"]' . with replacing {your-module-name} and {your-cluster-name} as appropriate.

    "content": "Provose keeps sensitive information in Terraform state. Terraform synchronizes its operations by storing “state” about what has been deployed. By default, the state is written to the local filesystem, but Terraform also makes it easy to store state remotely–such as in an Amazon S3 bucket. This allows multiple contributors to run Terraform on different machines while only keeping one synchronized copy of state. Other Terraform modules avoid writing sensitive information to Terraform state, instead writing sensitive information to the local filesystem. However, this makes it more difficult to synchronize Terraform on multiple machines. Provose assumes that your Terraform state is secure. We recommend storing state in an encrypted, versioned Amazon S3 bucket that can only be accessed by the AWS accounts that need to run Terraform. Provose believes in trusted VPCs. Many organizations structure their cloud infrastructure with the principle of defense-in-depth. However, Provose creates VPCs and provisions resources in them with network access open to other resources within the VPC. Provose makes the assumption that resources deployed within the same VPC can trust each other, and that defense-in-depth should be practiced by deploying unrelated resources in separate, unpeered VPCs. Provose recommends using AWS credentials that cannot destroy resources. Provose and Terraform have some superficial protection of important resources, like enabling deletion protection by default on AWS Relational Database Service (RDS) databases. ",
