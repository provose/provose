# Provose Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)

These are Amazon Machine Images that are built for the [Provose](https://provose.com) project. Provose is a new and easy way to configure cloud infrastructure. Provose uses these images internally for launching hosts for [`aws_instance`][1], [`container`][2], and other configurations.

## Building these AMIs

These AMIs are built using [Hashicorp Packer][3], and the source code
for the AMIs can be found at [https://github.com/provose/provose-amis][4] .
